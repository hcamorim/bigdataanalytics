Repo for the Big Data Analytics course and its final project

This project (and the oral examination that followed it) was presented as the final evaluation for the Big Data Analytics (R) course at CBS. For that project, students were expected to choose a topic, find credible data sources or generate the data themselves, and apply course learnings to extract insights. Additionally, the exam clearly stated that it was mandatory for the project to contain feasible business suggestions/recommendations (data-driven decision making). Beyond submitting the 15-page exam, students were also expected to submit the code in R. As per the course's page, the learning objectives of the course were: 

1. Characterize the phenomena of Big Data, Big Data Analytics, and apply different concepts, methods, and tools for analysing big data in organisational/societal contexts.
2. Understand the linkages between business intelligence/analytics and the potential costs to and benefits for organisations.
3. Demonstrate the applicability of various analytical techniques and algorithms on the big/organisational/social/open datasets to derive critical insights.
4. Critically assess, reflect and present the findings of big data analytics in terms of meaningful facts, actionable insights and their impact on organisations and society.
5. Analyse and apply different visual analytics concepts and tools for big datasets.
6. Exhibit deeper knowledge and understanding of the topics as part of the project and the report should reflect on critical awareness of the methodological choices with written skills to accepted academic standards.

This Repo will contain the exam specifications, my final exam paper, the database utilized, and the code in R.
